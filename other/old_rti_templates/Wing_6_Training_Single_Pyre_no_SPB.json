  "description": "> *Zommoros has invited you to participate in the very first private tour of the Mystic Forge. Witness the incredible inner workings of the djinn's magical domain, and uncover the dark secret that lurks at its center.*\nThis is the sixth raid wing and one of the hardest raid wings for training groups currently. There are three encounters:\n<:conjuredamalgamate:703930783496405082> **Conjured Amalgamate** - An easy bursty boss which heavily favours power DPS.\n<:largos:703930782275731498> **Twin Largos** - A difficult set of two bosses which heavily favours condi DPS.\n<:qadim:703930782649024573> **Qadim** - A difficult boss which requires power DPS.\n\nThe <:alac_healer:1176639815282856017> **Heal Alacrity (Tank)** will be expected to tank for <:largos:703930782275731498> **Twin Largos** and <:qadim:703930782649024573> **Qadim**. High toughness is recommended.\n\nThe ðŸŸ£ **DPS (Portal + Pull)** will be expected to use `Portals` and pull the `Magma Elementals`. Only <:mesmer:675414199211393036> **Mesmer** DPS builds (with Focus) are qualified to do this.\n\nThe ðŸ”º **DPS (Kiter)** will be expected to do the `Kiting` mechanic on <:qadim:703930782649024573> **Qadim**. We recommend <:deadeye:818854511342780416> **Rifle Deadeye** or <:soulbeast:818775299805413386> **Soulbeast** for this role. Check our PoVs in <#1053246449212739604> for a demonstration of how it's done.\n\nThe ðŸ”» **DPS (Lamp)** will be expected to do the first two `Lamp` mechanics alone. We **highly** recommend <:daredevil:766682602580475944> **Power Daredevil** for this role, but <:reaper:839262566168657961> **Power Reaper** can also do it. Check our PoVs in <#1053246449212739604> for a demonstration of how it's done.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",
