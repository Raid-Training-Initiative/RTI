  "description": "> *After the events in the Mystic Forge, Qadim has returned home to the Hidden City of Ahdashim to usurp a great power. Seek the Key and the cardinals for guidance into the hallowed city walls and stop Qadim from destroying not only the djinn, but also the natural balance of the world.*\n\nThis is <:qadimthepeerless:703930782749818940> **Qadim the Peerless**, the last boss of the seventh raid wing.\n\nThe <:alac_healer:1176639815282856017> **Heal Alacrity (Tank)** will be expected to tank, and high toughness via gear such as `Minstrel's` or `Giver's` is strongly recommended.\n\nThe ü§é **Heal Alacrity** will be expected to do the `Anomalies` mechanic, which requires a bit of ranged hard/soft CC.\n\nThe ü©∏ **DPS (Pylon Kiter)** will be expected to do the `Pylon Kiting` mechanic. The only three builds that can reliably perform the role are <:scourge:763701209122471958> [**Condition Scourge**](https://snowcrows.com/builds/necromancer/scourge/condition-scourge), <:virtuoso:948585484165210162> [**Condition Virtuoso**](https://snowcrows.com/builds/mesmer/virtuoso/condition-virtuoso), and <:deadeye:818854511342780416> [**Rifle Deadeye**](https://snowcrows.com/builds/mesmer/virtuoso/condition-virtuoso).
