  "description": "In this encounter we'll be fighting <:ministerli:954126378364715059> **Minister Li** on CM, which is one of the hardest encounters in the game right now that requires fast reflexes and good coordination. I encourage everyone who comes to be familiar with the **normal mode** of this strike.\n\nThe <:quick_dps:1022999237824352416> **DPS Quickness Firebrand** will be expected to take the skill `Stand Your Ground!` for <:stability:844163847161774121> **Stability**.\n\nThe <:alac_healer:1023021148612595793> **Heal Alacrity (Kiter)** will be expected to kite the `Orange Shots` from the Sniper. For this role, a good amount of toughness (exotics is fine!) is strongly recommended.\n\nThe ðŸŸ¥  **DPS (Tank)** will be expected to tank the Enforcer and the Mech. The only requirement is that the DPS class you come on has a long-range blink. <:virtuoso:948585484165210162> **Virtuoso** and <:mechanist:948585084842287184> **Mechanist** are good options.\n\nThe ðŸ”´ **DPS** can take either power or condi DPS, but condi *tends* to perform better and ranged damage is extremely helpful. Good classes are <:virtuoso:948585484165210162> **Condi/Power Virtuoso**, <:scourge:763701209122471958> **Condi Scourge**, <:harbinger:948585473645903903> **Condi Harbinger**, and <:mechanist:948585084842287184> **Condi Mechanist**.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",
