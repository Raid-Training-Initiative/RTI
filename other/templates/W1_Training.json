  "description": "*A Pact squad has gone missing in northern Maguuma, and you and your allies are their only hope for recovery. But the deadly forest isnâ€™t the only risk to the rescue operationâ€”the area holds dark secrets and strange magic.*\n\nThe Spirit Vale is the first released raid wing and consists of four encounters:\n<:valeguardian:703930901997944833> **Vale Guardian** - A medium difficulty boss that takes increased power damage. \n<:spiritwoods:836193678631764009> **Spirit Woods** - An easy encounter where we have to succeed at a multitude of events.\n<:gorseval:703930783198347284> **Gorseval** - An easy boss where any kind of DPS is fine.\n<:sabetha:703930783320113192> **Sabetha** - A medium difficulty boss where any kind of DPS is fine.\n\nPower and condi DPS are both fine for this wing, but two players will need to play ðŸŸ¥ **Condi DPS** on <:valeguardian:703930901997944833> **Vale Guardian** to deal with the red guardian.\n\nThe :alacrity_healer: **Heal Alacrity (Tank)** will be expected to tank for <:valeguardian:703930901997944833> **Vale Guardian** and <:gorseval:703930783198347284>  **Gorseval**. Tanking is toughness-based, so you're expected to take some toughness via gear such as `Minstrel's` or `Giver's` to take aggro.\n\nThe ðŸ¤Ž **Heal Alacrity (Seeker Control + Kiter)** will be expected to do `Seeker Control` for <:valeguardian:703930901997944833> **Vale Guardian** and `Kiting` for <:sabetha:703930783320113192> **Sabetha**. Watch our PoVs in <#776399505376411659> for videos showing how to do that!\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",
