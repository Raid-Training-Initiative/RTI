  "description": "This is the fifth raid wing which is commonly regarded as the most difficult raid wing in the game currently. We will have four encounters:\n<:soullesshorror:703930782841962557> **Soulless Horror**: A difficult first boss that heavily favours condi DPS.\n<:riverofsouls:703930782636572723> **River of Souls**: An easy encounter that favours having a few extra healers.\n<:brokenking:703930780539158599> **Statues of Grenth**: An easy set of three mini bosses.\n<:dhuum:703930782590304346> **Dhuum**: A very difficult boss that slightly favors condi DPS.\n\nThe ‚óªÔ∏è **Quick DPS (Tank / G3)** will be expected to tank for both <:soullesshorror:703930782841962557> **Soulless Horror** and <:dhuum:703930782590304346> **Dhuum**. High toughness is required, but otherwise come on a DPS build (`Trailblazer's` / `Seraph's` are good stat combos). They will also be expected to do the `Greens` on <:dhuum:703930782590304346> **Dhuum**.\n\nThe üíö **Heal Alacrity (Pusher @ SH / Kiter @ Dhuum)** will be expected to do the `Pushing` role on <:soullesshorror:703930782841962557> **Soulless Horror**. The recommended build is <:druid:763700489011068939> **Heal Druid**. It will also be expected to do the `Kiting` and `Greens` roles on <:dhuum:703930782590304346> **Dhuum**.\n\nThe <:alac_healer:1023021148612595793> **Heal Alacrity (Tank @ SH)** will be expected to run high toughness to tank for <:soullesshorror:703930782841962557> **Soulless Horror**.\n\nThe ‚ö´ **Scourge (Epidemic)** will be expected to help with killing the `Tormented Dead` on <:soullesshorror:703930782841962557> **Soulless Horror**.\n\n`**IMPORTANT**`: If you are doing the `Greens` on <:dhuum:703930782590304346> **Dhuum**, then come prepared! There are guides showing how to practise it solo in the <#776399505376411659> channel! You must be able to perform the mechanic reliably before joining the squad.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",
