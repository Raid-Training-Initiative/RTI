  "description": "In this encounter we'll be fighting <:ministerli:954126378364715059> **Minister Li** on CM, which is one of the hardest encounters in the game right now that requires fast reflexes and good coordination. I encourage everyone who comes to be familiar with the **normal mode** of this strike.\n\nI strongly recommend that everyone comes with a `Jade Bot Core: Tier 10` (or as high as you can get the tier to be). There are hard-hitting attacks in this fight that you may have to facetank which the extra vitality helps with.\n\nThe <:quick_healer:1022999250109485146> **Heal Quickness (Kiter / Stability)** and <:quick_dps:1022999237824352416> **Quick DPS (Stability)** will be expected to take <:stability:844163847161774121> **Stability** for the boss's dragon slash attack.\n\nThe <:quick_healer:1022999250109485146> **Heal Quickness (Kiter / Stability)** and <:alac_healer:1023021148612595793> **Heal Alacrity (Kiter)** will be expected to kite the `Orange Shots` from the Sniper. For this role, a good amount of toughness (exotics is fine!) is strongly recommended.\n\nThe ðŸŸ¥ **DPS (Tank)** will be expected to tank the Enforcer and the Mech. The only requirement is that the DPS class you come on has a long-range blink. <:virtuoso:948585484165210162> **Virtuoso** is by far the best for this, but <:mechanist:948585084842287184> **Condi Mechanist** is also a good option. Check out <#1053246449212739604> for a POV of this, and I would also strongly recommend practising this in the `In the Name of the Law` story instance and also in normal mode pugs. Just be the closest to the boss and in front of it!\n\nThe ðŸ”´ **DPS** can take either power or condi DPS, but condi *tends* to perform better and ranged damage is extremely helpful. Good classes are <:virtuoso:948585484165210162> **Condi/Power Virtuoso**, <:scourge:763701209122471958> **Condi Scourge**, and <:mechanist:948585084842287184> **Condi Mechanist**.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",
