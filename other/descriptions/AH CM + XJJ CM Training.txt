We will be tackling the first two EoD Strike Missions :maitrin:  **Atherblade Hideout** and :ankka: **Xunlai Jade Junkyard** in the challenge mode! **No experience with the NM of both encounters is required!**

Any type of DPS works for both encounters, but range DPS classes like power or condition Virtuoso :virtuoso:, power Mechanist :mechanist: , condition Specter :specter: or condition Scourge :scourge: help us to manage the reasonable DPS check.

For :maitrin:  **Atherblade Hideout CM** it is recommended to bring extra CC and projectile block/destruction.
For  :ankka: **Xunlai Jade Junkyard CM** bringing extra CC is also strongly recommended.

If you have any questions, send me a message!
