This is the fifth raid wing which is commonly regarded as the most difficult raid wing in the game currently. We will have four encounters:
:soullesshorror: **Soulless Horror**: A difficult first boss that heavily favours condi DPS.
:riverofsouls: **River of Souls**: An easy encounter that favours having a few extra healers.
:brokenking: **Statues of Grenth**: An easy set of three mini bosses.
:dhuum: **Dhuum**: A very difficult boss that slightly favors condi DPS.

The :white_medium_square: **Quick DPS (Tank @ SH)** will be expected to tank for both :soullesshorror: **Soulless Horror**. High toughness is required, but otherwise come on a DPS build (`Trailblazer's` / `Seraph's` are good stat combos). 

The :green_heart: **Heal Alacrity (Pusher @ SH / Kiter @ Dhuum / G2)** will be expected to do the `Pushing` role on :soullesshorror: **Soulless Horror**. The recommended build is :druid: **Heal Druid**. It will also be expected to do the `Kiting` and `Greens` roles on :dhuum: **Dhuum**.

The :alac_healer: **Heal Alacrity (Tank / G3)** will be expected to run high toughness to tank for :soullesshorror: **Soulless Horror** and :dhuum: **Dhuum**. They will also be expected to do the `Greens` on :dhuum: **Dhuum**.

The :black_circle: **Scourge (Epidemic)** will be expected to help with killing the `Tormented Dead` on :soullesshorror: **Soulless Horror**.

**IMPORTANT**: If you are doing the `Greens` on :dhuum: **Dhuum**, then come prepared! There are guides showing how to practise it solo in the #boss_guides channel! You must be able to perform the mechanic reliably before joining the squad.

Let me know if you have any questions!
