We will be tackling the first two EoD Strike Missions on Challenge Mode:
:maitrin: **Aetherblade Hideout CM**
:ankka: **Xunlai Jade Junkyard CM**

No experience with the normal mode of both encounters is required, but it helps!

Any type of DPS works for both encounters, but ranged DPS classes like :virtuoso: **Power/Condi Virtuoso** , :specter: **Condi Specter**, :scourge: **Condi Scourge**, and :harbinger: **Condi Harbinger** tend to perform better for :ankka: **Xunlai Jade Junkyard**.

For :maitrin: **Aetherblade Hideout CM**, it is recommended to bring extra CC and projectile block/destruction.
For :ankka: **Xunlai Jade Junkyard CM**, bringing extra CC is also strongly recommended.

Let me know if you have any questions!
