*The search for a missing Pact leader continues as you and your allies venture deeper into the Forsaken Thicket. Strange magical energy has run amok, and long-hidden mysteries wait to be brought to light.*

This is the second raid wing of the Forsaken Thicket. We will have to face three encounters:
:slothasor: **Slothasor** - A fairly hard boss that requires pulls and good CC.
:trio: **Trio** - An easy encounter that has no particular requirements.
:matthias: **Matthias** - A medium difficulty fight that favours condi DPS.

There will be no designated tanks for this raid. Tanking on :slothasor: **Slothasor** is chosen at random during regular intervals of the fight, and tanking on :matthias: **Matthias** is irrelevant.

The :quick_dps: **Quick DPS Firebrand** will be expected to share :stability: **Stability** for :slothasor: **Slothasor** to negate the :fear: **Fear**, and they will also be expected to handle reflects at :matthias: **Matthias**.

Let me know if you have any questions!
