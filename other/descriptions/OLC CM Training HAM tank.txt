In this event we'll be doing :oldlionscourt: **Old Lion's Court** on CM, which is a difficult encounter that requires good positioning, high boon uptime, and solid execution of mechanics. I encourage everyone who comes to be familiar with the **normal mode** of this strike.

If we finish with time to spare we can try getting the `Defender of Lion's Court` title afterwards!

The :quick_dps: **DPS Quickness** can come on any class that gives :quickness: **Quickness**, but it's worth noting that :herald: **Herald** and :scrapper: **Scrapper** are both fantastic for this role in this fight.

The :alac_healer: **Heal Mechanist (Tank)** will be expected to tank the `Prototype Vermilion` (Red Knight) and `Prototype Arsenite` (Green Knight) on :mechanist: **Heal Mechanist**. High toughness via `Giver's` or `Minstrel's` gear (exotics are fine!) is strongly recommended. Check our PoVs in #boss_guides for a demonstration of how it's done!

The :red_circle: **DPS** can take either power or condi DPS, but condi *tends* to perform better and ranged damage and CC are extremely helpful. :virtuoso: **Condi/Power Virtuoso** is strongly recommended, but good alternative classes are :scourge: **Condi Scourge**, :harbinger: **Condi Harbinger**, :specter: **Condi Specter**, and :mechanist: **Condi Mechanist**.

Let me know if you have any questions!
