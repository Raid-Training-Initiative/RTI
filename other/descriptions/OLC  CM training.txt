It time to beat down with the Watchwork Knight Triumvirate!

Here's your chance at a training for :oldlionscourt: **Old Lion's Court CM** with RTI! No experience with NM needed, but it might help :catthumbsup:

Having **Ranged DPS**, and access to **plenty of CC** (also preferably ranged) will make this considerably smoother. If your chosen class has access to a blink skill, this could also prove useful but is not necessary

:clipboard: If we beat the CM fast enough, remaining time will be used to go for the `Defender of Lion's Court` title afterwards.

Special Roles:
:alac_healer: **Alac Healer (Green Tank)**, will tank the Green knight away from the group.
:quick_healer: **Quick Healer (Red Tank)**, will tank the Red Knight with the group, except for Blue+Red where it will be away from the group.
Bringing good toughness gear is recommended for both tanks!

Some suggested builds to consider:
* :alac_dps:**Alac DPS** -> :mechanist: Power Alac Mechanist; :mirage: Condition Alacrity Mirage; :specter: Condition Alacrity Specter
* :quick_dps:**Quick DPS** -> :herald: Power Quickness Herald; :scrapper: Power Quickness Scrapper
* :red_circle:**DPS*** -> :virtuoso: Condition/Power Virtuoso; :specter: Condition Specter; :mechanist: Condition Mechanist
