If you're struggling to join our community or start raiding, be sure to check our quickstart guide!

This FAQ covers most of the information that people commonly miss when new to RTI.
_ _
`[1] How do I join your raids?`
First, join our community (i.e. get the **Member** role on Discord)! Read the #welcome channel and follow our requirements before applying, including ensuring you have "Allow direct messages from server members" turned on in our server's **Privacy Settings**.
_ _
`[2] When do you normally raid?`
Training runs can take place on any day and time of the week (often at `20:00 CET/CEST (GMT+1/2)`).
Our timezones are [CET](https://time.is/CET) and [CEST](https://time.is/CEST), depending on whether or not we're in the summer period and daylight savings is active.
_ _
`[3] How do I sign up for a raid?`
Once you have joined RTI and received the **Member** role, you can sign up for our raids with our Discord bot, @RtiBot#4883! Raids organised using the bot will show up in the `CURRENT RAIDS` category of our Discord as separate channels and in our #ðŸ“…raid_schedule channel.

To sign up for any raid, simply click the :pencil: reaction underneath the post in the raid's channel. You will then get a DM from the bot asking you what you want to sign up as, and simply follow the instructions to sign up. Be sure to read the description of any raid you sign up to, because we organise a variety of raids with a variety of requirements.

You will get a message from @RtiBot#4883 an hour before the raid is starting and there is also a time at the bottom of each of our raid embeds (the `Your Time` footer) which converts the raid's scheduled time to your timezone. If you're still unsure, hit the :clipboard: **Personal Schedule** button in #ðŸ“…raid_schedule to get a countdown for each raid you've signed up to!

Note that if you still need your first ever raid kills on some bosses, you can even request a training in #training_requests and you'll get priority to join!
_ _
`[4] What happens if I sign up as reserve?`
Signing up as reserve is a very effective way of opening up your opportunities to raid with us.

When signing up via the bot, you can sign up for the reserve role you want to fill (e.g. ðŸ”´ **DPS**), and you will then get pinged if that specific spot opens up. If you can play multiple roles, you can choose to sign up as ðŸ§© **Multiclass** and get notified if _any_ spot opens up.
_ _
`[5] Do I need to be able to talk on Discord voice chat?`
You must be able to listen during an RTI run (hearing impairments notwithstanding). Talking is not required but is encouraged.
_ _
`[6] What is a raid-ready character?`
We consider a character raid-ready when:
`[â€¢]` It follows a meta build (see [Snow Crows](https://www.snowcrows.com/) and #class_guides for builds you can choose from).
`[â€¢]` It has the right stats, runes, sigils, and relic.
`[â€¢]` You understand how to play your class and have looked through and practised the skill rotation on your build's Snow Crows page.
`[â€¢]` You have at least your weapons and trinkets on ðŸŸ£ **Ascended** rarity, with armour on at least ðŸŸ  **Exotic**. Please note that this is a soft requirement and we are not strict about your gear's rarity, but we ask that you are realistic about what standard is acceptable and keep in mind that running subpar gear is a detriment to the squad.

We recommend that, if you join on a damage-oriented role, you have both power- and condition-damage builds available to use.

Be aware that if you are returning to the game after a break, the builds you may be familiar with are probably no longer in use, and/or their gear may have changed significantly. Always check that your builds are up to date. If you wish to use any other build that isn't listed on Snow Crows or have any concerns, always ask the raid leader for the raid you want to sign up for.
_ _
`[7] Do I need join the in-game guild or be an active member?`
There are no requirements on representing or even joining the in-game guild (but if you wish to do so, check out #guild_join_requests). There is also no requirement to be active to remain a member of RTI, but do note that we regularly clear out inactive members (i.e. people who have not logged into the game for a while) from our in-game guild.
_ _
`[8] I messed up and received a warning! What does this mean?`
We send out anonymous warnings for behavioural infractions mentioned in #rules. The vast majority of our warnings are for when people don't follow **Rule #5**, which covers:
a) Not showing up for a raid.
b) Showing up but leaving earlier than the specified duration.
c) Unregistering from a raid within 30 minutes before it starts.
d) Showing up to a raid unprepared (e.g. description of a :dhuum: **Dhuum** training asked for experience with the "greens" mechanic and you had no experience).

Each warning is saved into our system, and you get temporarily banned from joining RTI raids (and kicked from any raids you're currently in) if you hit **three** warnings in a rolling period of **6 months**. Persistent infractions to our rules after the initial three will be met with longer ban periods, including an eventual permanent ban, which is done for extreme cases.
_ _
`[9] What are the different types of events?`
The events we organise typically fall under three categories: "training run", "practice run", and "kill run".

**Training runs**
- These are aimed at players who are **completely new** to the encounter.
- They are organised by @Commanders.
- An explanation on how the encounter works will be provided.
- The focus is NOT to get a kill but to train and understand the encounter.
- You can get priority for these via #training_requests.

**Practice runs**
- These are aimed at players who have **killed** or **trained** the encounter at least once before but might not be entirely familiar/confident yet.
- They are organised by @Commanders and @Lieutenants.
- An explanation on how the encounter works will not be provided. Questions, however, are welcome.
- The focus is NOT to get a kill but to train and practise the encounter.

**Kill runs**
- These are aimed at players who have **killed** the encounter at least once before AND are confident enough on their role to not hold the squad back.
- They are organised by @Commanders and @Lieutenants.
- An explanation on how the encounter works will not be provided. Questions, however, are welcome.
- The focus is to get the kill within the allotted time.

We do not have KP requirements in this community, and we mostly operate on a good-faith system - always read the descriptions of the events you sign up to and ask the leader of the event if you have questions. We are, in the end, a training guild, and we are tolerant to mistakes and gaps in knowledge, but do your best to understand the expectations!
_ _
`[10] Can anyone organise a raid / training run?`
We have an #lfg channel where anyone can organise or fill existing groups. Here are some rules to follow for that channel:
1. Make sure to ping the correct role! Failure to do so will cause your message to be deleted.
  - @LFG for raids and strike CMs.
  - @Strikes for normal-mode strikes.
  - @Fractals for fractals.
  - @Dungeons for dungeons.
  - @Open World for open world (HP trains, guild missions, etc).
2. Use the threads created under each message to discuss or express interest in LFG postings.
3. Add a `/sqjoin` or `/join` command so people know how to join your group.
4. Specify the level of experience you expect (but do NOT ask for any amount of killproof or LI).

We also have a #community_events channel where anyone who has the @Member role with us can organise an event. Just type `/lfg start` in that channel and go through the dialogue to organise an event with us. Again, killproof requirements are not allowed.

If you're interested in organising official raids with the community on a regular basis, especially training runs, then please check out #join_the_team and we can talk about enrolling you into our staff ranks.

`[11] RTI raids fill up too quickly! What do I do?`
It is difficult to get into raid trainings, but here are some tips to give you better chances of getting into raids with us:
`[â€¢]` Have your ping notifications turned on for this server. We ping people every time a new official raid is published. Be sure to go to the **Channels & Roles** tab at the top left and opt in to additional ping roles for even more opportunities!
`[â€¢]` Keep an eye on our #ðŸ“…raid_schedule which lists both official raids our staff members organise and unofficial community events.
`[â€¢]` If you still need your first kills on certain bosses, then request a raid training in #training_requests and you may get a spot reserved for you in a future raid!
`[â€¢]` Sign up as reserve for runs you didn't get into on time. We regularly ping all reserves of a raid if a spot opens up.
`[â€¢]` Be as multiclass as you can. Gearing roles that give :quickness: **Quickness** or :alacrity: **Alacrity**, or roles that heal while giving boons (such as :druid: **Druid**, :firebrand: **Quickness Firebrand**, or :mechanist: **Heal Mechanist**) makes it much easier to get spots in our runs, as they are in far more demand than DPS.
`[â€¢]` Look out for runs in #lfg and #community_events (or organise some yourself!).
`[â€¢]` Join the in-game guild via #guild_join_requests. Runs are advertised there on a regular basis.
`[â€¢]` If you want to practise specific roles on specific wings/bosses, then make a request in #special_role_requests and you may get a spot reserved for you in a future raid!
_ _
`[12] I have <insert disability here>. Am I still able to raid with you?`
Yes! Sometimes we get people joining with certain disabilities, such as hearing impairments, colour blindness, learning disorders, physical disabilities, etc. This often can make it more daunting to join training raids.

Don't feel ashamed to let us know if you need us to make any accommodations. We are happy to make some changes to how we do things, such as giving you one-on-one sessions to help you with certain challenges, having someone transcribe what the commander is saying on voice chat to you in typing, or at the very least exercising a level of understanding of your situation if we notice you struggling with certain things.

The important thing is that you let the commander of the raid you're joining know in advance so that we are able to make these accommodations!
