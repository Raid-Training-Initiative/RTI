If you're struggling to join our community or start raiding, be sure to check our quickstart guide!

This FAQ covers most of the information that people commonly miss when new to RTI.
_ _
`[1] How do I join your raids?`
First, join our community (i.e. get the **Member** role on Discord)! Read the #welcome channel and follow our requirements before applying, including ensuring you have "Allow direct messages from server members" turned on in our server's **Privacy Settings**.
_ _
`[2] When do you normally raid?`
Training runs can take place on any day and time of the week (often at `20:00 CET/CEST (GMT+1/2)`).
Our timezones are CET and CEST, depending on whether or not we're in the summer period and daylight savings is active.

`[3] How do I sign up for a raid?`
Once you have joined RTI and received the **Member** role, you can sign up for our raids with our Discord bot, @RtiBot#4883! Raids organised using the bot will show up in the `CURRENT RAIDS` category of our Discord as separate channels and in our #ðŸ“…raid_schedule channel.

To sign up for any raid, simply click the :pencil: reaction underneath the post in the raid's channel. You will then get a DM from the bot asking you what you want to sign up as, and simply follow the instructions to sign up. Be sure to read the description of any raid you sign up to, because we organise a variety of raids with a variety of requirements.

You will get a message from @RtiBot#4883 an hour before the raid is starting and there is also a time at the bottom of each of our raid embeds (the `Your Time` footer) which converts the raid's scheduled time to your timezone. If you're still unsure, hit the :clipboard: in #ðŸ“…raid_schedule to get a countdown for each raid you've signed up to!

Note that if you still need your first ever raid kills on some bosses, you can even request a training in #training_requests and you'll get priority to join!
_ _
`[4] What happens if I sign up as reserve?`
Signing up as reserve is a very effective way of opening up your opportunities to raid with us.

When signing up via the bot, you can sign up for the reserve role you want to fill (e.g. ðŸ”´ **DPS**), and you will then get pinged if that specific spot opens up. If you can play multiple roles, you can choose to sign up as ðŸ§© **Multiclass** and get notified if _any_ spot opens up.
_ _
`[5] Do I need to be able to talk on Discord voice chat?`
You must be able to listen during an RTI run (hearing impairments notwithstanding). Talking is not required but is encouraged.
_ _
`[6] What is a raid-ready character?`
We consider a character raid-ready when:
`[â€¢]` It follows a meta build (see <https://snowcrows.com/> and #class_guides for builds you can choose from).
`[â€¢]` It has the right stats, runes, and sigils.
`[â€¢]` You understand how to play your class and have looked through and practised the skill rotation on your build's Snow Crows page.
`[â€¢]` You have at least your weapons and trinkets on ðŸŸ£ **Ascended** rarity, with armour on at least ðŸŸ  **Exotic**. Please note that this is a soft requirement and we are not strict about your gear's rarity, but we ask that you are realistic about what standard is acceptable and keep in mind that running subpar gear is a detriment to the squad.

We recommend that, if you join on a damage-oriented role, you have both power- and condition-damage builds available to use.

Be aware that if you are returning to the game after a break, the builds you may be familiar with are probably no longer in use, and/or their gear may have changed significantly. Always check that your builds are up to date. If you wish to use any other build that isn't listed on Snow Crows or have any concerns, always ask the raid leader for the raid you want to sign up for.
_ _
`[7] Do I need join the in-game guild or be an active member?`
There are no requirements on representing or even joining the in-game guild (but if you wish to do so, check out #guild_join_requests). There is also no requirement to be active to remain a member of RTI, but do note that we regularly clear out inactive members (i.e. people who have not logged into the game for a while) from our in-game guild.
_ _
`[8] I messed up and received a warning! What does this mean?`
We send out anonymous warnings for behavioural infractions mentioned in #rules. The vast majority of our warnings are for when people don't follow **Rule #5**, which covers:
a) Not showing up for a raid.
b) Showing up but leaving earlier than the specified duration.
c) Unregistering from a raid within 30 minutes before it starts.
d) Showing up to a raid unprepared (e.g. description of a :dhuum: **Dhuum** training asked for experience with the "greens" mechanic and you had no experience).

Each warning is saved into our system, and you get temporarily banned from joining RTI raids (and kicked from any raids you're currently in) if you hit **three** warnings in a rolling period of **6 months**. Persistent infractions to our rules after the initial three will be met with longer ban periods, including an eventual permanent ban, which is done for extreme cases.
_ _
`[9] Whom do I speak to if I have an issue with another member?`
Speak to an @Officer. Screenshots of the (entire) conversation, if it happened in game, are immensely useful. Any action taken will depend upon the severity of the transgression.
_ _
`[10] Can anyone organise a raid / training run?`
Anyone is allowed to post an LFG in the #lfg channel by pinging the LFG role. We do, however, have an important rule: You cannot ask for LI or kill proof in these channels, unless it is not an RTI run (e.g. the PUG you are in - which you are currently not leading - is looking for more people).

If you're interested in organising official raids with the guild on a regular basis, especially training runs, then please check out #become_a_commander and we can talk about enrolling you into our staff ranks.

`[11] RTI raids fill up too quickly! What do I do?`
It is difficult to get into raid trainings, but here are some tips to give you better chances of getting into raids with us:
`[â€¢]` If you still need your first kills on certain bosses, then request a raid training in #training_requests and you may get a spot reserved for you in a future raid!
`[â€¢]` Have your ping notifications turned on for this server. We ping people every time a new official raid is published. Be sure to go to #ping_settings and opt in to additional ping roles for even more opportunities!
`[â€¢]` Sign up as reserve for runs you didn't get into on time. We regularly ping all reserves of a raid if a spot opens up.
`[â€¢]` Be as multiclass as you can. Gearing roles that give :quickness: **Quickness** or :alacrity: **Alacrity**, or roles that heal while giving boons (such as :druid: **Druid**, :firebrand: **Heal Firebrand**, or :mechanist: **Heal Mechanist**) makes it much easier to get spots in our runs, as they are in far more demand than DPS.
`[â€¢]` Join the in-game guild via #guild_join_requests. Runs are advertised there on a regular basis.
`[â€¢]` If you want to practise specific roles on specific wings/bosses, then make a request in #special_role_requests and you may get a spot reserved for you in a future raid!
_ _
`[12] I have <insert disability here>. Am I still able to raid with you?`
Yes! Sometimes we get people joining with certain disabilities, such as hearing impairments, colour blindness, learning disorders, physical disabilities, etc. This often can make it more daunting to join training raids.

Don't feel ashamed to let us know if you need us to make any accommodations. We are happy to make some changes to how we do things, such as giving you one-on-one sessions to help you with certain challenges, having someone transcribe what the commander is saying on voice chat to you in typing, or at the very least exercising a level of understanding of your situation if we notice you struggling with certain things.

The important thing is that you let the commander of the raid you're joining know in advance so that we are able to make these accommodations!
